[Friesen and Shine (2019)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0339) hypothesized that within a species, individuals at the boundary of its range experience different ecological pressures than individuals at the center of its range. One specific hypothesis they had was that males at the boundary should have smaller testes.
